My name is *Bj√∂rn Ricks*. I am a software developer at [Greenbone] living in the
north of Germany.

# Open Source

I've started to contribute to Free Software during my Computer Science studies
and got involved in the community of the former OpenSync framework. After a
while I did maintain most parts of the [CMake] based build environment (btw. I
never understood autotools and got involved because the project just started to
migrate to CMake which I really liked at the time).

At the end contributing to this open source project caused that I met a lot of
nice people and joined [Intevation] to work on free software full time.

# Python

Being a C/C++ and Java developer before (and some Basic, Pascal and Delphi as a
teenager), at [Intevation] I've started to work with Python (if I remember
correctly it was Python 2.5 at that time). While not having interfaces or
definitions Python felt a bit strange to me first but I began to like it very
much because you can write code very fast and easily. Shortly after Python
became my favorite programming language which it is still today.

For example my current (pet) projects [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks)
and [pontos](https://github.com/greenbone/pontos) are written in Python.

# Greenbone

After some more years and working at a different company as a Java EE/JavaScript
developer I switched to Intevation's child company [Greenbone]. Greenbone is the
provider of the most widely used open source vulnerability management solution
known as OpenVAS.

At Greenbone I've been working in several roles already. From a JavaScript
developer responsible for the [React] based Greenbone Security Assistant Web UI,
to a team lead and manager, through a product owner, I am in a software
developer role again working on DevOps topics.

Because I care a lot about communities and free software/open source I always
try to find some spare time for improving obstacles that are not always product
related. Often by [writing and extending docs](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/),
answering questions in our [community forum](https://forum.greenbone.net) and
reacting to user issues at [GitHub](https://github.com/greenbone).
